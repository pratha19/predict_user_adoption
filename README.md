# mini_project_17.2_predict_user_adoption
 
The project involves identifying which factors predict future user\
adoption where an "adopted user" is defined as a user who has logged into the product on \
three separate days in at least one sevenday period.

The data is available as two attached CSV files:  
takehome_user_engagement.csv  
takehome_users.csv  
The data has the following two tables:    

1] A user table ( "takehome_users" ) with data on 12,000 users who signed up for the\  
product in the last two years. This table includes:  

● name: the user's name  
● object_id: the user's id    
● email: email address  
● creation_source: how their account was created. This takes on one of 5 values:  
	 	   	○ PERSONAL_PROJECTS: invited to join another user's personal workspace

	  	   	○ SIGNUP: signed up via the website
	  	   	○ SIGNUP_GOOGLE_AUTH: signed up using Google Authentication (using a Google email \
		     	account for their login id)   
			
● creation_time: when they created their account  
● last_session_creation_time: unix timestamp of last login
